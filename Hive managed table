  //                      Import database tables from mysql to hive directory using sqoop :
$sqoop import-all-tables  --connect jdbc:mysql:// quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db --username sujit --password sujit
--as-textfile  --warehouse-dir=/root/hive/warehouse/retail_db.db
//Here retail_db is mysql databse and i have created username & password as sujit
//We have created directory in hive but we have not created database on top of this 
//We can check retail_db into hadoop 
$hadoop fs –ls /user/hive/warehouse
$hadoop fs –ls /user/hive/warehouse.retail_db.db
//this is the retail_db.db directory that is being created as a result of import from mysql through sqoop.
//Create database and table on top of hdfs`s
//Next we have to create database and then table – remember name of database, tables and
//table fields its datatype all should match then only mapping will be done and we will be
//able to access record from table via hive.
hive>  create database retail_db;
hive>use retail_db;
hive>create table orders(order_id INT,order_date date,order_customer_id INT,order_status varchar(20))
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ STORED AS TEXTFILE;
//TABLE IS CREATED MAPPING OF THIS TABLE AND DATA INTO DIRECTORY OF /USER/HIVE/WAREHOUSE WILL TAKE PLACE.
//Now we can access record from hive also .
hive>select * from retail_db.orders limit 10;
hive>describe formatted orders;    // this command will describe table as managed table
